The above link contains 3 folders named: "affwildnet-vggface-gru" , "affwildnet-resnet-gru" and "vggface".

The "vggface" folder contains two subfolders with 2 different models (same architecture; their only difference is the training strategy that has been deployed): both models are CNN networks based on VGG-FACE (with 3 fully connected layers with 4096, 4096 and 2 units respectively).
The "affwildnet-vggface-gru" folder contains the AffWildNet architecture (with no landmarks) as described in the paper entitled: "Deep Affect Prediction in-the-wild: Aff-Wild Database and Challenge, Deep Architectures, and Beyond".
The "affwildnet-resnet-gru" folder contains the AffWildNet architecture (with no landmarks and no fully connected layer) as described in the paper entitled: "Deep Affect Prediction in-the-wild: Aff-Wild Database and Challenge, Deep Architectures, and Beyond".

The architectures-structures have been implemented in the Tensorflow environment.
